//! Package managers: identity, resolved-source claims, and the wire protocol.
//!
//! A [`PackageId`] names a package as a `(pm, name, version)` tuple and a
//! [`PackageResolution`] couples a reported coordinate with the source class
//! and opaque key its package manager resolved. An [`UnvalidatedPlugin`] is
//! what a PM answers with: the canonical shapes from the
//! [registry-centric plugin distribution
//! RFD](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium/blob/main/md/rfds/registry-centric-plugins/README.md).
//! They live in the SDK because they cross the PM boundary: both Symposium and
//! a package-manager binary speak in them.
//!
//! [`PackageManager`] is the operation set every package manager implements,
//! whether Symposium calls it in its own process or over the wire.
//! [`protocol`] is the JSON-RPC wire format, and [`server`] is the harness that
//! turns an implementation into a PM binary.

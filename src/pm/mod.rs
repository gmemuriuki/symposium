//! Package managers: the seam from the [registry-centric plugin
//! distribution RFD](../../md/rfds/registry-centric-plugins/README.md).
//!
//! A [`PackageId`] names a package as a `(pm, name, version)` tuple, and a
//! [`PackageManager`] resolves ids of its ecosystem to content on disk. The
//! trait is the SDK's, so a package manager written against it runs either
//! way: called directly in this process, or as a binary behind [`RemotePm`].
//!
//! A `PackageManager` value is an *instance*, not just an ecosystem. A
//! **transport** ([`CargoPm`]) can `fetch` any id of its ecosystem, because the
//! id carries the source; a **registry instance** ([`PathPm`]) fronts one
//! configured source and enumerates the packages it contains. [`PmRegistry`]
//! holds them as one flat set: an id is dispatched to the instance whose
//! [`PackageManager::name`] matches its [`PackageId::pm`] (`fetch`,
//! `load_plugin`), while `list_deps` and `search` union every instance.
//!
//! A registry instance's [`PackageManager::name`] is the *configured registry
//! name* (`user-plugins`, `symposium-recommendations`, …), which is also the
//! `pm` component of every id it mints and the name its plugins are attributed
//! to. Registry instances resolve their own ids, so those ids are never routed
//! through the ecosystem transports.
